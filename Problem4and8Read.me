Problem 4 and 8

This program generates 10 graphs at random with 20 verticies and displays them as lists of edges. The number of edges for each graph can be any number between 10 and 50 (although each graph could have up to 190 edges, that seemed like it might be overkill when representing them as a list of edges). For each graph, the program finds each connected components within each graph and displays which verticies are interconnected or isolated, should that be the case for any vertices.
