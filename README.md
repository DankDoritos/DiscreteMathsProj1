Group Project 1 for Team Cantaloupe

Team Members: Nicholas Wood, Munk Batjargal, Connor Holland, Eli Madi

Project Instructions:
1.   Your program should have a menu:  
Catchy Name (you provide) or Team Name Conversion Program
i.Convert base 10 to binary
ii.Convert binary to base 10
iii.Convert base 16 to binary
iv.Convert binary to base 16
v.End program
2.   Your program should prompt the user to enter a number in the base (you need to specify).
3.   Your program should display the converted number to the screen.
4.   After displaying the output, your program should redisplay the menu until the user chooses End program.  
5.   Your program should have appropriate comments, including the citing of any sources of images you use (if any, no images are required).  
6.   At or near the top of your program, please include your team name and the names of your team members.  
     Our class, your teacher, the date, and a short description of your program.  See example below.

Menu-driven program to convert numbers from base 10 to 2, from 2 to 10 and using the short cut methods between 16 and 2. 
*/7.   Use the algorithms we did in class (they are on Canvas if you need a reminder).
We did “any base to ...” but the above conversions are the ones you will need most often.   You may NOT use any built-in conversion tools.  
You need to find a way to implement the algorithms we learned.  Look up tables are fine for the short cuts between 2 and 16.
